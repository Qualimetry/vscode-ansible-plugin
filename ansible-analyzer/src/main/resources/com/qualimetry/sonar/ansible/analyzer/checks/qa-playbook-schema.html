<p>The playbook or role file does not match the expected YAML/Ansible structure (e.g. missing hosts, invalid key under tasks). Fix the structure so the file is valid and can be executed.</p>
<h3>Ask yourself whether</h3>
<ul><li>You have a play with no hosts, or tasks with invalid keys.</li></ul>
<h3>Recommended practices</h3>
<ul><li>Ensure each play has hosts and that task entries have a module or include. Follow Ansible playbook structure (plays, tasks, handlers).</li></ul>
<h2>Noncompliant</h2>
<pre>- tasks:
    - name: Bad
      debug: {}  # play has no hosts</pre>
<h2>Compliant</h2>
<pre>- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ok
      debug: { msg: ok }</pre>
