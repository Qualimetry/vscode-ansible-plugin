<p>Trailing spaces or tabs at the end of lines add no meaning and clutter version control diffs. They can also cause inconsistent behavior in some contexts (e.g. copied strings, comparisons).</p>
<p>Removing trailing whitespace keeps playbooks clean and makes diffs easier to read. Most editors can trim whitespace on save or on demand.</p>

<h3>Ask yourself whether</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You often paste or type at the end of lines without clearing extra spaces.</li>
  <li>Your team wants clean diffs and consistent formatting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommended practices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Enable "Trim trailing whitespace" (or equivalent) in your editor.</li>
  <li>Use a formatter or pre-commit hook that strips trailing whitespace.</li>
</ul>
