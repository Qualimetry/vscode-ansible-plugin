<p>Playbooks with many plays in one file become hard to navigate and maintain. Splitting into multiple playbook files (and using import_playbook) keeps each file focused and makes it easier to run subsets.</p>
<h3>Ask yourself whether</h3>
<ul><li>This playbook has many plays that could be split by environment or concern.</li><li>You want a main entry point that imports smaller playbooks.</li></ul>
<h3>Recommended practices</h3>
<ul><li>Use import_playbook to include other playbook files. Keep the main file (e.g. site.yml) to a few plays and import the rest.</li></ul>
<h2>Noncompliant</h2>
<pre># 10+ plays in one file
- hosts: a
  tasks: []
- hosts: b
  tasks: []</pre>
<h2>Compliant</h2>
<pre># site.yml - main entry
- hosts: all
  tasks: []
- import_playbook: db.yml
- import_playbook: app.yml</pre>
