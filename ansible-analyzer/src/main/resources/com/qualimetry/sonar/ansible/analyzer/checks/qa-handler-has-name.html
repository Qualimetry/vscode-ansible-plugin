<p>Handlers should have a name so they can be identified in run output and when using notify. Unnamed handlers show only the module name, which makes debugging and auditing harder.</p>
<h3>Ask yourself whether</h3>
<ul><li>Someone will need to see which handler ran from logs or output.</li><li>You use notify with handler names and want them to be descriptive.</li></ul>
<h3>Recommended practices</h3>
<ul><li>Add a short, descriptive name to each handler. Place name first, as with tasks.</li></ul>
<h2>Noncompliant</h2>
<pre>handlers:
  - service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted</pre>
<h2>Compliant</h2>
<pre>handlers:
  - name: Restart nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted</pre>
